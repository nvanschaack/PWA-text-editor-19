## Installation
This application is deployed off heroku, so there is no need to open a terminal and run commands. There is an install button on the PWA itself once you open it, and once installed can be accessed locally on your computer while also being offline.

## Usage
This is a simple application that allows a user to type text like one would on a notes app, for example. This text-editor can work online or offline. In both cases, the data typed will be automatically saved to the indexed DB.

## License
  
  This application is covered under the MIT license.
